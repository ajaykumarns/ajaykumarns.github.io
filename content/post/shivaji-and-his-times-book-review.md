After reading this [book](https://archive.org/details/shivajihistimes00sarkrich), I am in total awe and utter amazement thinking about this man we all know as *Chatrapati Shivaji*. I would like to salute this giant among Hindus a million times and even that wouldn't be enough to express the respect and gratitude I feel towards this man. 

For he showed us that it was possible to re-establish Hindu Swaraj and reclaim this sacred land we all know as भारतः(Bharath). While his own personal life was cut short due to illness[^1], I wonder how history would have changed course had he lived a longer life.

<blockquote>
Shivaji was the greatest Hindu king that India had produced within the last thousand years; one who was the very <b>incarnation of lord Siva</b>, about whom prophecies were given out long before he was born; and his advent was eagerly expected by all the great souls and saints of Maharashtra as the <b>deliverer of the Hindus from the hands of the Mlecchas</b>, and as one who succeeded in the reestablishment of Dharma which had been trampled underfoot by the depredations of the devastating hordes of the Moghals 
<br/>

## The Book

Quite honestly, it's a shame that such a wonderfully researched book has almost disappeared and allowed to be forgotten. I was fortunate enough to know about this book due to mentions on twitter as well as thankful🙏 to [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/shivajihistimes00sarkrich) for uploading a scanned version of this book.
   
As Sarkar mentions in this book, he has worked with different sources include official persian letters exchanged by Moghuls, Bijapur Shah as well as British sources. Note that this book is **not a monologue about the life of Shivaji** and Sarkar explains why:

> The Marathas were only one among the many threads in the tangled web of Deccan history in the 17th century. Therefore to understand the truse causes and full consequences of Shivaji's own acts and policy, it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of the internal affairs of the Mughal empire, Bijapur and Golkonda also.

## Initial years of Shivaji
In the beginning sections of the book, we get to know about Shivaji's early years, his constant fights with the Mughals and finally his becoming as a Chatrapathi.

### Shivaji's youth and his surroundings
The author starts with introducing the audience to the environment and the land Shivaji grew up in. This helps us understand what moulded Shivaji into the great king who eventually challenged the barbaric Moghuls; Abandoned by his father at a very early age, he was brought by completely by his devout Hindu mother who inspired him stories from Hindu epics such as Mahabharata and Ramayana. Besides having a martial background (thanks to his father who was under the service of Bijapur Shahs), the hostile land challenged the young boy making him resolute and strong enough to take on challenges. 

Later on we see, how Shivaji captured a number of forts and took hold of lands near Puna; We also learn about his first war with the Mughals and attempts at peace making with Aurangazib.

### Afzal Khan
One of the most widely talked about events in Shivaji's life is his victory over Afzal Khan, a general under Bijapur Goverment sent to bring Shivaji under control. Initially Shivaji was invited by Afzal Khan to discuss terms through a Hindu priest(Krishnaji Bhaskar Kulkarni); Learning that Afzal has nefarious intentions, Shivaji wears arms under his clothes(including a tiger claw later used to disembowel Afzal) and a metal plate under his turban(which indeed saved him) and meets Afzal Khan accompanied by two body guards. 

Leaving his body guards, Shivaji enters Afzal's tent. Afzal attempting to fool Shivaji, gives him a friendly embrace. It is said that Afzal is almost 7' feet tall and physically strong while Shivaji was comparatively short and thin man. Sounds almost like *David meets Goliath* doesn't it? Any guesses asto who won the encounter?

Afzal taking advantage of his brute physical strength, tries to suffocate Shivaji by tightening his left arm grip. Shivaji almost loses consciousness but somehow regains his strength when he chants his guru's name. He disembowels Afzal using the tiger claws fatally injuring him in the process. Shivaji runs out of the tent but narrowly escapes a fatal blow from one of Afzal's body guards(Sayyid Banda). Later Afzal's entire army is routed by Shivaji's army thus marking the rise of this great emperor.


### Jai Singh and visit to Aurangazib
Next we read about [Jai Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Singh_I), one of Aurangazib's trusted generals who is sent to the deccan to subdue Shivaji. A clever and well tempered person, he forms alliances with the local enemies and almost brings down Shivaji's main fort **Purandar**. Finally Shivaji relents and signs the treat of Purandar. 

{{< figure src="/images/shivaji_jaisingh.jpg" title="Treaty of Purandar">}}

Under this treaty, the marathas surrender a number of forts to Mughals as well as agree to server under Aurangazib. Under the personal assurances of Jai Singh, Shivaji along with his son Shambuji is sent to the Mughal court to meet the emperor, Aurangazib. Things do not go as expected; Shivaji does not like the way he is treated in the court and feigning illness retires to his quarters along with his supporters. Later he along his folks are placed under arrest. 

Another well known story throughout India, Shivaji and his son escape by concealing themselves in small baskets. Concealing themselves as saints, they manage to get back home and the hostilities against Moghuls renew. We later learn of Shivaji renewing his peace agreement with the Moghuls and later his victories against moghuls.
He also sacks Surat, one of the richest ports in India back then. The british factories are left untouched by the Marathas (Sarkar describes that british held out on their own while the rest of the traders ran away). 

There is constant friction between some of the generals(Dilir Khan) sent by Aurangazib himself and Price Muazzam. Once even Shivaji is invited by Price Muazzam to apprehend Dilir Khan who runs to safety! Shivaji in the mean time, loots Surat for the second time sealing the fate of the port forever. Fearing future raids, most of the traders move to safer ports thereby abandoning one of the richest ports in the west.

### Coronation of Shivaji
We learn about the lavish ceremony crowning Shivaji as the Chatrapathi. Sarkar believes that Marathas aren't originally Kshatrias but Shivaji is declared as one by a brahmin named **Gaga Bhatta**. A huge amount of money is spent on this event and finally Marathas have an emperor of their own. Unfortunately, Shivaji's mother dies only 10 days later which most of the people consider as a bad omen[^2]. In the final sections of the chapter IX, we get to know about his raids into neighboring counties as well as those of Moghul camps. 

## Wars and events after his Coronation
In the middle section of the book, Sarkar describes his naval strength, constant tussle with the Siddis and his invasion of Karnatak.


### Shivaji's navy
Shivaji early on realizes the importance of Naval strength. We get to learn more about Shivaji's navy and the different types of boat employed in service. Shivaji being a true Hindu, without regards to religion recruits the strongest and most experienced folks into his navy including Misri and Daulat Khan (Siddis). Besides controlling trade, the navy is also used to plunder and raid enemy territories.
Unfortunately for the Marathas, the Abyssinians(who are muslims of African descent) settled in Janjira in the early 16th century.

<br/>
Neither Shivaji nor any of his future Marathas are completely able to take over Janjira. The book talks about constant war between the two parties ending in stalemates. Abyssinians also take support of Mughals to counter Marathas. 


### Khanderi 
Unable to conquer Janjira, Shivaji directs his men to build a fort in Khanderi which is a small island near mumbai. However the british feel that this threatens their Bombay port pushing them into a conforntation with the Marathas. Unable to defeat them, British make peace with Shivaji later on.

### Invasion of Karnataka
As Sarkar describes in his book, after the coronation of Shivaji, the treasury was running low and Shivaji needed to replenish it. So he started focusing on the south especially Karnataka and Tanjore which was ruled by his half-brother [Vyankoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekoji_I). One of disgruntled ministers Raghunath, meets Shivaji and invites him to invade the south.

Raghunath is also instrumental in Shivaji forming an alliance with Golkonda's wazir [Abdul Hassan Qutb Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_Hasan_Qutb_Shah) who was initially apprehensive of meeting Shivaji due to the later's reputation as the killer of Afzal Khan. After the formalties, Shivaji marches on and visits srisailam on a pilgrimage.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d627383.3311866861!2d78.51417970273363!3d16.154425838494774!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3bb5656d70792343%3A0xb2342e1f2ed1834b!2sSrisailam%2C+Andhra+Pradesh+518101%2C+India!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1460274020141" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br/>
<br>

Deeply influenced by the purity of his place, Shivaji under religious frenzy attempts to cut of his own head! As Sarkar mentions, one can understand how much Shivaji was a devoted Hindu

> Shivaji ascended this difficult plateau, bathed in the Krishna and spent some ten days at Shri Shaila doing religious rites. The quite and secluded beauty of the scenery and the spiritual atmosphere of the place penetrated his soul, and he believed that he would find no purer spot to die in. So he attempted to cut off his own head before the goddess; but his ministers restraind his religious frenzy and recalled him to a sense of his duty to his subjects and the **Hindu world at large**.

### Conquest of Gingee and Vellore
Through some clever negotiations, Shivaji qcquired [Gingee Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingee_Fort) without a fight[^3]. He later fights with Sher Khan Lodi and after a long siege acquires [Vellore Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellore_Fort). 

### Tanjore
Finally Shivaji meets his half-brother Vyankoji where they tussle over the inheritance left by their father Shahji. But Vyankoji disagrees and quitely runs away during the night. Deciding not to invade Tanjore, he proceeds to conquer Bangalore and other places in Mysore. Vyankoji in the meantime, tries to drive away Marathas by attacking the Vellore fort which was under the control of Shantaji(Another half brother of Shivaji). However Vyankoji's forces are defeated and he finally settles for peace with the marathas.

## Final years
Shivaji died as a troubled man during his final years. Besides constant tussle with Bijapur and Mughals, he faced some setbacks including his son's desertion to Mughals and domestic trouble.


### Shambuji
Sarkar does not have kind words to describe Shambuji. Shambuji was placed under arrest in Panhala fort due to his addiction to **sensual pleasures**. Unfortunately, he later deserted to the mughal side[^4] under Dilir Khan. Quoting the book:

> Dilir khan was thrown into transports of joy at the desertion of Shivaji's heir to his side. "He felt as happy as if he had conquered the whole Deccan!. He beat his drums in joy and sent a report to the Emperor.

Bijapur grew weaker due to internal tussle between various sections (afghans etc..). Upon Bijapur's request, Shivaji defended it against Mughal invasion under Dilir Khan. It is interesting to know that Shambuji defected back to the Marathas after having a disagreement with Dilir Khan over his mistreatment of Hindus. His heart always bled for Hindus[^5] 

### Death
Shivaji died of fever and dysentry on 24-03-1680. Following his death there was major struggle between his younger son Rajaram and Shambuji, the later prevailing to become the next Chatrapathi of Marathas. The final chapters of this book describe his goverment, institutions and policies. 


[^1]: Or treachery depends on whom you ask.
[^2]: I believe that Shivaji's mother sensing her days are coming to an end, wanting to see her son crowned as Chatrapathi probably pushes him to do so.
[^3]: This fort was used by Chhatrapati Rajaram during the tough time when Marathas were decimated by Mughals.
[^4]: He later comes back to the maratha side only to be re-imprisoned in panhala.
[^5]: Shambuji was later tortured and killed by Aurangazib for refusing to convert to Islam.

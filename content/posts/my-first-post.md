I placed an order for Pandora's Lab after reading about it in Abhinav Agarwal's blog titled "**Best books I read in 2019 and 2018**" [^1]. This was a quick read and I thoroughly enjoyed reading each chapter of the book. As a matter of fact, I would highly recommend carrying this book as your travel companion since its pretty easy to pick up where you left off without having to remember too many details.

**NOTE:** _Spoilers below, you've been warned_

While each story was enlightening in its own way, the following chapters had a huge impact on me.

# Blood from Air
Being a huge admirer of everything german, I was pleasently surprised to learn artificial nitrogen fixing was invented by the German scientist named __Fritz Haber__. It turned that besides winning the Nobel for his invention, he also helped the German imperial empire during WW-I and Nazi Germany during WW-2 to weaponize his process to produce explosives, poisonous gases, etc... 

But the most interesting twist in the story was the fact that Fritz was a Jew which did not turn out well during WW-II __(hint: Hitler)__. It was very painful to read about how his poisonous gas inventions were used against Jews in WW-II concentration camps. I can only imagine Fritz screaming in pain not being able to do anything about it since, _the bird was already out of the cage_.

Without his invention to convert inert atmospheric nitrogen into fertilizers, I wonder how many of us would have gotten a chance to be born in this world?

# America's Master Race
I would say without a doubt this was my most favorite chapter. I was shocked to learn that the concept of *eugenics* was born in the USA and how one the books published to support race theory was gobbled up by none other than __Hitler__ himself while being imprisoned after WW-I. He went onto even highlight this in his work "__Mein Kampf__".

While American shows and movies are full of stories how brave American heroes(_Captain America_ among others) liberated Germans and Jews from concentration camps, I have never heard or seen a movie about this fact. Yet another shameful chapter in American history (don't forget the Native American genocide!). Googling about this throws up so many articles online[^2] [^3].

# Turning the Mind Inside Out
This story reminded me about [Shutter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island_(film)) which goes into treatment of patients deemed insane using horrific and barbaric surgeries.

# The Mosquito Liberation Front
Explores the topic of DDT and how it was banned from the first world. Surprised to know that DDT is still being manufactured and used in India[^4].

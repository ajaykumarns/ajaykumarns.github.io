Hi there and welcome to my bookshelf! Here is a collection of books that I've read (along with links to reviews) as well as books that I'm planning to read. Please note that this list is not exhaustive and I intend to update it once all my books are back with me in BLR(FYI, I've moved across oceans to BLR). 

I'm afraid I have fallen into the practice of whats called Tsundoku(積ん読); ordering books from amazon but never reading them. By maintaining this page, I hope to reduce my book pile and be concious of what I'm reading.

This was a quick read and I thoroughly enjoyed reading each chapter of the book. As a matter of fact, I would highly recommend carrying this book as your travel companion since its pretty easy to pick up where you left off without having to remember too many details.</p><p><a target=_blank href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1426217986/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=1426217986&linkCode=as2&tag=ajayns-21&linkId=c8f2663bdfef70b2d9f59e26f59ef2e9"><img border=0 src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=IN&ASIN=1426217986&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=ajayns-21"></a><img src="//ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=ajayns-21&l=am2&o=31&a=1426217986" width=1 height=1 border=0 alt style=border:none!important;margin:0!important></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Spoilers below, you&rsquo;ve been warned</em></p><p>While each story was enlightening in its own way, the following chapters had a huge impact on me.</p><h1 id=blood-from-air>Blood from Air</h1><p>Being a huge admirer of everything german, I was pleasently surprised to learn artificial nitrogen fixing was invented by the German scientist named <strong>Fritz Haber</strong>. It turned that besides winning the Nobel for his invention, he also helped the German imperial empire during WW-I and Nazi Germany during WW-2 to weaponize his process to produce explosives, poisonous gases, etc&hellip;</p><p>But the most interesting twist in the story was the fact that Fritz was a Jew which did not turn out well during WW-II <strong>(hint: Hitler)</strong>. It was very painful to read about how his poisonous gas inventions were used against Jews in WW-II concentration camps. I can only imagine Fritz screaming in pain not being able to do anything about it since, <em>the bird was already out of the cage</em>.</p><p>Without his invention to convert inert atmospheric nitrogen into fertilizers, I wonder how many of us would have gotten a chance to be born in this world?</p><h1 id=america-s-master-race>America&rsquo;s Master Race</h1><p>I would say without a doubt this was my most favorite chapter. I was shocked to learn that the concept of <em>eugenics</em> was born in the USA and how one the books published to support race theory was gobbled up by none other than <strong>Hitler</strong> himself while being imprisoned after WW-I. He went onto even highlight this in his work &ldquo;<strong>Mein Kampf</strong>&rdquo;.</p><p>While American shows and movies are full of stories how brave American heroes(<em>Captain America</em> among others) liberated Germans and Jews from concentration camps, I have never heard or seen a movie about this fact. Yet another shameful chapter in American history (don&rsquo;t forget the Native American genocide!). Googling about this throws up so many articles online<sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2>2</a></sup> <sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3>3</a></sup>.</p><h1 id=turning-the-mind-inside-out>Turning the Mind Inside Out</h1><p>This story reminded me about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island_(film)>Shutter Island</a> which goes into treatment of patients deemed insane using horrific and barbaric surgeries.</p><h1 id=the-mosquito-liberation-front>The Mosquito Liberation Front</h1><p>Explores the topic of DDT and how it was banned from the first world.

This app must be banned for intentional malpractices.</p><p>First, the location of the restaurants are fake. They labeled the one right next to my home as being in the next city. The app only shows the city/town but not complete addresses of the vendor. Without this information, one cannot distinguish between multiple restaurants bearing the same name (with one providing good vs bad quality food) nor can you look up ratings on google or yelp since, the vendor identifying information is incomplete.</p><p>Second, the app itself provides feedback mechanism for orders with fields to capture detailed feedback from user. I provided my feedback but no action seems to have been taken. Also as a user you cannot read feedback written by other users. The app only provides aggregated ratings for any vendor. I found out the actual restaurant location by following the order pick up status and found wide disparity between ratings on google vs swiggy which makes me wonder if any information displayed on the app can be trusted.</p><p>Overall if the company cannot guarantee the quality of food delivered, it should not list the vendor in its app. Also reacting to customer feedback seems like a good thing to do.</p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/swiggy>swiggy</a></li><li><a href=/tags/reviews>reviews</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Â©Ajay Nadathur, 2020.

Here is a collection of books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read (along with links to reviews) as well as books that I&amp;rsquo;m planning to read. Please note that this list is not exhaustive and I intend to update it once all my books are back with me in BLR(FYI, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved across oceans to BLR).
I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I have fallen into the practice of whats called Tsundoku(積ん読); ordering books from amazon but never reading them.</description></item></channel></rss>

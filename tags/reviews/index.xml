I fell sick for a week after eating food that I ordered through swiggy. Please find a copy of my review on iOS app store down below. (Sorry about the bit wanting to ban the app but, I wrote this review while going through severe diahorrea/stomach cramps)
My App Store review I am sitting in the toilet for the past two days with severe stomach ache and body pain after consuming food ordered through swiggy.</description></item><item><title>Bookshelf</title><link>https://gyanfull.in/page/bookshelf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 20:53:07 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://gyanfull.in/page/bookshelf/</guid><description>Hi there and welcome to my bookshelf! Here is a collection of books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read (along with links to reviews) as well as books that I&amp;rsquo;m planning to read. Please note that this list is not exhaustive and I intend to update it once all my books are back with me in BLR(FYI, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved across oceans to BLR).
